              <h3>Cesme</h3>
              <p>
                The Çeşme Peninsula, due west of İzmir, and its towns of Çeşme,
                Alaçatı and Ilıca, is a major regional holiday destination. The
                port for ferries to Chios, the Greek island, is in the town of
                Çeşme.Çeşme (CHESH-meh, “fountain” or “spring,” pop. 100,000) is
                a pleasant enough, popular sun-and-beach resort town, especially
                for visitors from İzmir, Scandinavia and the United
                Kingdom.Çeşme’s main strolling and shopping street is lined with
                nice old Ottoman-style houses.

              <h3>Urla</h3>
              <p>
                Urla is close to the metropolitan city of Izmir. This lovely
                fishing town is 10 minutes away from the Izmir city center. If
                you directly drive into Urla, you would say Urla has good nature
                and sea. But it has a lot more… Urla is a local secret and it is
                mostly free from the tourist crowds.Urla is a hidden gem and I
                will reveal its hidden locations one by one. The main thing that
                separates Urla from other Aegean towns is its people.

              <h3>Foca</h3>
              <p>
                Named after ancient Phocaea, which was an ancient Ionıan
                seafarers town located between what is now Eski and Yeni Foça
                and founded around 1,000 B.C., Foça is rich in history and
                historical significance. The very name itself refers to the
                critically endangered Mediterranean Monk seals, one of the most
                rare mammals in existence, of which only a few hundred remain in
                the region. The area is therefore environmentally protected and
                much of the architecture and structure remain intact.

              <h3>Teos</h3>
              <p>
                The large port city of Teos, located on the Aegean coast of
                Turkey, was once the center of the Artist Guild of Ionia. Its
                extensive ruins, including those of the renowned Temple of
                Dionysus, make a visit to the site worthwhile. It is located
                very near the town of Sigacik and is 18 kilometers from the town
                of Seferihisar.
